# Pokedex Web App
A repo containing the code for my web app pokedex. The live version of this is available now at:
https://people.rit.edu/jtv6445/230/project2/

## Why does this exist?
This project started as a collaboration between myself and my friend (coincidentally also named Justin) as we were trying to learn how to properly access API's and pull information from them. We found the PokeAPI online as a recommended resource for learners and the concept of a Pokedex naturally emerged from that.

## Who did what?
I made the front-end design (which in retrospect is a bit garrish), hooked up the API to populate to left nav with the first generation of pokemon, designed whatever imagery that you see on the page aside from the pokemon type (ie poison, fire, etc) icons and the pokemon sprites. I also built the search bar which returns a given pokemon based on it's identifying number, the stats API calls and visualizers, and finally the sprite calls and toggler. The remainder of the work was completed either entirely or partially by my teammate.

## Wait, I have more questions!
Good news for you, you can reach me through the contact portion of my website at https://jvaughn.org/
